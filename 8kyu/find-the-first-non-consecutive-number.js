// Description:

// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

// If you like this Kata, maybe try this one next: https://www.codewars.com/kata/represent-array-of-numbers-as-ranges

// 1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

//My Solution

//P: Always numbers, always more than 1, never empty, unique numbers, ascending ordfer. positive and negative
//R: A number that is not consecutive
//E:
//// [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] => 6
//// [1,2,3,4] => null
//P: check each num if they are all more than the previous by one return null if not return that num

function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; ++i) {
      if (arr[i] + 1 !== arr[i + 1]) {
        return arr[i + 1]
      }
    }
    return null
  }


  //CodeWars
  function firstNonConsecutive (arr) {
    let result = arr.find((val, index) => val !== index + arr[0]);

    return (Number.isInteger(result)) ? result : null;
}
